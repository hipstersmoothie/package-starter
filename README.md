# Package Starter

This is a project that has all the tools I use set up so I can get straight to coding.

Tools Used:

* lint - [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo) - Opinionated but configurable ESLint wrapper with lots of goodies included.
* test - [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) - Delightful JavaScript Testing. 
* build - [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) - A compiler for writing next generation JavaScript.
* formatting - [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - An opinionated code formatter. This will format your code on commit.
* release - [github-semantic-version](https://github.com/ericclemmons/github-semantic-version) - Automated semantic version releases powered by Github Issues.
